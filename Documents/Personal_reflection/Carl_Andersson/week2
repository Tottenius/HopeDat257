What do I want to learn or understand better?
I would like to get a better understanding of how to use git and github. Learned a bit last week and is now able to use it but not completly conftable with everything yet.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I think I can, same as last week, help others get a better understanding of git, github and scrum by just talking about it and making sure everyone is familiar with the concepts.

What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
Being an active group member and following the social contract.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
