What do I want to learn or understand better?
Now that we have finished our project and presented it I can't think of something that I have to learn.
The only thing left is the report that I have to get a better understanding of the be able to contribute to in a good way, but other than that I can't think of something.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Since the only thing left is the report I believe I can help the the group by just working with the other team members to finish it and hope we can learn togheter how to write a good report.

What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
Not really much to do here now the project is done. I have been attending meetings and planning the report.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I have helped cleaning the project from unesed code, helped with the presentation of the project and written some documentation.
