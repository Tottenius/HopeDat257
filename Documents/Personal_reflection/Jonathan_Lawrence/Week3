We decided on using JavaFx and Scenebuilder for our project. I have programmed in Java before but I haven’t used JavaFx or Scenebuilder
so I would like to learn more about them. I am also trying to learn more about branches in GitHub.

2.	
Hopefully I can help the team with the use of branches in GitHub when I have more knowledge about it and assist the team wherever I can.

Continue being active during our daily scrum meetings and remember to submit my values for our KPI:s every day. 
Keep being active on Trello so the team knows what I’m doing and so that I’m up to date on how the project is going.

4.	
I have helped with creating and working on our user stories. I have also participated in discussing and writing the team reflection. 
I was active and helped while coming up with a preliminary design for the GUI of our application.
