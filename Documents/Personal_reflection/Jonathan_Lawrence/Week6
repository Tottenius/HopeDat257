1.	
I am getting a better understanding of JavaFX and Scenebuilder but there’s still a lot to learn 
so I would still like to continue improving my skills and knowledge by coding and reading or watching tutorials.

2.	
I help the team when I can whether it’s explaining how something works or just working towards solutions together.

3.	
I have participated during all of our daily scrum meetings and have been active during our discussions. 
I also fill in my KPI:s during every daily meeting and use our Trello board regularly.

4.	
I have participated in the development of the remote database. I have also helped with the redesign of our GUI. 
I have been active when discussing and creating our team reflection for this week and have written parts of it.
