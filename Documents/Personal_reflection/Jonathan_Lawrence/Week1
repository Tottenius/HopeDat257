1.	
I would like to get a better understanding of github. I already know the basics, 
but I think it that both me and the team would benefit by me learning more about github and specially how it works together with an IDE. 
I also want to get a better understanding of agile project management and more specifically scrum.

2.	
Try to help if someone needs it. Even if I donâ€™t know the answer it can still help trying to work towards a solution together. 
If I know more about something, I should take responsibility to help others with that 
and I should be open about what I need help with so that everyone in the team is aware and no one falls behind.

3.	
Be active during our scrum meetings and take part in discussions. 
Help finalise the board on Trello. 
Actively use Trello to stay up to date on the project and help update the board when needed.

4.	
Being active during our discussions while forming social contract and coming up with the KPI:s. 
Trying to come up with ideas for our project and taking part in the discussions to try and find a good idea for our project.
