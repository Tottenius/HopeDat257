Since I have mostly worked on the remote database the majority of the coding I have done
has been in Java and not with JavaFX and Scenebuilder. However, the tutorials I have watched and read 
helped when I have joined in and helped with designing and working on our GUI for example. 
For next week I canâ€™t think of anything in particular that I would like to learn more about. 
Just working with the project and using the agile process will increase my experience and knowledge. 
One thing I can do for next week is to read through all of our code now that everything is almost finished 
to get a good overview and see if anything is missing or can be improved.

Like always I offer to help the team if I notice it might be needed. 
I also try to listen out if anyone asks for help and work towards a solution together or explain something if needed.

I have been at every daily meeting as usual and have taken part in discussions. 
I have filled in my KPI:s every day. I try to keep an eye on the Trello board to stay updated 
and use it to keep the team updated on what I am doing. I also try to keep a check on the KPI:s of the other team members 
to see if there are values out of the ordinary and if they need help for example.

The remote database that we started pair programming last week is now almost finished with all the features we want it to have. 
There are a few things that need to be added to the server and some testing to do to ensure the communication with the server works well. 
The aim is to have the remote database completely finished today or beginning of next week. 
The design of our GUI is also finished now. I have contributed to the weekly team reflection 
by writing and partaking in the discussions about what to write.
