I am more comfortable with GitHub now. But I would still like to continue learning about Java FX and Scenebuilder. 

2.	
I keep a look out if someone needs help and try to help with what I can or help find a solution. 
I support the team where I can. I’m focusing on learning more about Java FX and Scenebuilder 
like i've written above so that I can assist my team with that if needed.

3.	
I have been present at all our meetings and tried to be part of our discussions. 
I’m still entering my KPI measurements every day and I’m updating and adding to our scrum board.

4.	
I have worked on improving our user stories and adding acceptance criteria’s and tasks to them 
so it’s clearer what we must do for each user story and when they are done. 
I have also helped with our definition of done.
