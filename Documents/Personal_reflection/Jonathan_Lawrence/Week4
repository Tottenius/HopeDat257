1.	
I would like to continue learning about JavaFX and Scenebuilder since I still feel that I don’t know enough about it 
so I can contribute more during the next week. 
I also want to learn a little more about the integration between Git and our IDE so I can work more seamlessly.

2.	
I have helped the team with getting a better understanding about branches in GitHub since I read about branches last weekend. 
Other than that, I try to help where I can and look out if I see that anyone needs help.

3.	
I am present at every daily meeting and always trying to be a part of our discussions and contribute as much as possible. 
I fill in my measurements for our KPI:s every day during our meetings. 
I try to come up with new ideas or suggestions on how to improve our application.

This week I haven’t put in as much time and effort as I would have liked because I have had a lot to do in another course, 
so I have had to focus on that. Hopefully next week is not as stressful and I can manage my time better 
so I can contribute more to our deliveries and also get more into the coding side of our application.
