1. what do I want to learn or understand better?
Last week was the final week of working on the application and as such have not been meaning to learn anything in that regard. 
Because we are "done" we can now start working on the final report, which will ressemble a team reflection with much more depth.

2. how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I can give my insights into what I have been working on during these past weeks and try to help the other members possibly incorporate that into the final report.

3. what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I have been attending every meeting except one to try and discuss and spitball some ways to write the report and what should be included. 


4. what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
Per point 3.  I have been discussing and assisting in any way I can.
