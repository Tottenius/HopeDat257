1. what do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to learn how to use git and Github better in my programming projects, as I've tried use it before without much luck. 
I got pushing and pulling from master to work, I think, still gonna need to figure out branches and such. Going to ask 
Oskar about it on monday if he can help. 


2. how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Some of the javaFx files use .xml, which I have some limited experience in, so I think I can probably shed some light if there are any questions. 

3. what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
Well we have had 4 meetings this week to settle our kpis and discuss what needs to be done. 

4. what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
Again, not much to add from last week. Since we still have not figured out branches, it gets a little scary to start with implementing the bigger features, since if 
a commit or push goes wrong it can ruin the whole project.
