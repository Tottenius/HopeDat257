1. what do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to learn how to use git and Github better in my programming projects, as I've tried use it before without much luck. 
I know there is a built in version control in the IDE I use (Intelij) so hopefully i can get that working without any hassle.

2. how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Be there if anybody needs a second opinion or for me to check something they have written, help by giving them my take on it. 

3. what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I suggested the use of Trello as a board to both get an overview and to use as a scrum board, 
so far it has been working fine and it gives a neat and organised start to the project

4. what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
Being active and trying to come up with ideas and solutions to any problems that may arise. 
So far it is the first week so we are still in the planning and preparation stage I suppose
