1. What do I want to learn or understand better?
I think since the project is nearing its end what I want to learn and understand better is how to prioritize, especially in a team what should be focused on and what should be left unfinished.
I think good communication and a clear goal for the program is key to doing this. I wanna learn how to come together as a group and set a plan for the future of the project. 

2. How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
This question feels a bit redudant at this point, after have answered it 7 times now. However as usual being available for people and helping as good as I can is what I can do to help the entire team.

3. What is my contribution towards the team's application of scrum?
Same as other weeks. Help with some of the structure of the trello board etc.

4. What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?
This week outside clearning up the code and helping others with problems they had I finialized the functionality to view your friends in the program. 
Which combined with the adding friends functionality I added last week works great for a very basic social tab for the program.
