1. What do I want to learn or understand better?
Since me and Tor are now starting to work on the database I wanna try to get back into SQL and how to do all the neccessary parts to create a database that I learnt last year in my previous database course.

2. How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Just doing my part of researching what I said I want to learn above.

3. What is my contribution towards the team's application of scrum?
Same as it usually is. Creating some idea for what to do on the sprints and how we should divide up the work on the database.

4. What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?
Just adding more code and pushing the project forward. 

Wanna note that me and Tor are working on the database on a secondary branch that we will when we have completed it merge with master branch 
and thats why may see less pushes and commits from us compared to the rest that are working on the java / scenebuilder side of the project!
