1. What do I want to learn or understand better?
More sql like last year. And how to implement some of the database idees.

2. How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Just doing my part of researching what I said I want to learn above.

3. What is my contribution towards the team's application of scrum?
Same as it usually is. Creating some idea for what to do on the sprints and how we should divide up the work on the database.

4. What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?
Just adding and writing more code and being present and pushing the project forward. 

Me and Tor are progressing the database well and we also did one merge with master branch for the login screen we made. Am confident in our project right now.
