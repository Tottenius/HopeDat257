# Customer Value and Scope
### The chosen scope of the application under development including the priority of features and for whom you are creating value
The scope of the application is moderate due to the limited time of the project. We will prioritize functionality like adding what you’ve eaten, 
changing days and having personalized data in an external database. And if we have spare time we will implement additional functionalities. 
### The success criteria for the team in terms of what you want to achieve within the project (this can include the application, but also your learning outcomes, your teamwork, or your effort)
As a team, the main goal for this week has been to finish the basic requirements for the graph drawing function of the application. 
It has also been to re-create and finish the design of the application, by changing the colors and what not. 
What we learn from this is mainly how JavaFX works and how to cooperate smoothly by agreeing about the design of the application.
### Your user stories in terms of using a standard pattern, acceptance criteria, task breakdown and effort estimation and how this influenced the way you worked and created value
We have used user stories to create tasks to figure out what to work with and how we can divide it between us. 
There hasn’t been much estimation on the user stories due to it being hard to estimate all tasks. 
But we have tried to make them relatively small and have clear acceptance criterias for them, even though we lacked them to begin with.
### Your acceptance tests, such as how they were performed, with whom, and which value they provided for you and the other stakeholders
Our definition of done at the moment is that we work together in groups of at least 3 group members to check the code together and make sure that everything looks okay. 
It might be a good idea to make this more formalized with for example a list of criterias that has to be filled.
### The three KPIs you use for monitoring your progress and how you use them to improve your process
Our three KPI:s are stress, communication and according to plan. Everyone fills in their individual values between 1 and 5 every weekday. 
If we notice that someone in the team has values out of the ordinary, for example high stress, we have a discussion and try to find a solution. 
That could be that others in the team do more work that week to make it less stressful for those with high stress. 
We have thought about adding another KPI to make it easier to monitor the status of the project so we can see if anything in our plan, 
or agile process needs changing but we haven’t thought of a good one yet. 
To find a fourth KPI we will have to discuss it during our daily meetings and see if we can find one that fits our project.

# Social Contract and Effort
### Your social contract, i.e., the rules that define how you work together as a team, how it influenced your work, and how it evolved during the project
The social contract has laid the foundation of how we as a team are supposed to be approaching this project. 
It is in the social contract we state that we are all supposed to be having a daily meeting where we talk over what we do, 
what we are supposed to do and how we achieve our goals for the week. 
It has also helped us expand our overview of the project by stating that you should always keep track if anyone needs any help with anything, 
by making sure the workload is as evenly as possible distributed amongst the team and making sure everyone gets their say about any features.
### The time you have spent on the course and how it relates to what you delivered (so keep track of your hours so you can describe the current situation)
The time we spent on the project varies very much throughout the week, depending on what needs to be done that specific week. 
Some days we spend more than 4 hours and others we spend less than 4.
This is something we need to work on, stating how much time we need to spend on the project to achieve our goals. 
So far though, we haven’t had any issues yet with any of the team members spending too little time.

# Design decisions and product structure
### How your design decisions (e.g., choice of APIs, architecture patterns, behaviour) support customer value
We have chosen to work with Javafx and build out views with scene builder. This gives us an easy way to make good looking UI's quite easily. 
And therefore create more customer value on that part. It also gives us a clear structure in how we build our application, 
which makes the process more efficient and therefore it’s easier to create more customer value.
### Which technical documentation you use and why (e.g. use cases, interaction diagrams, class diagrams, domain models or component diagrams, text documents)
We haven’t really used any technical documentation for this project, because we didn’t feel the need to with our scope of what we want our project to be. 
### How you use and update your documentation throughout the sprints
When we are finished with a method in our code, we make sure to add comments and documentation to ensure that every team member is aware and knows what each method is doing. 
This is to make sure if any questions arise, it is easy to get a decent understanding of what that specific method does more or less. 
Until the wondering member gets a chance to talk to the method creator. This is achieved by using built-in documentation tools, javadocs.
### How you ensure code quality and enforce coding standards
In our definition of done we have a criteria that the code is supposed to be tested and two to three people are to inspect the code before it can be labeled as done. 
This helps to ensure code quality.

# Application of Scrum
### The roles you have used within the team and their impact on your work
We haven’t used any specific roles within the team as we haven’t felt like it is needed. 
We all take our responsibility to show up to and participate in our daily scrum meetings and use the trello board to stay updated and update if needed. 
So far there hasn’t been any problems with this method.
### The agile practices you have used and their impact on your work
Daily scrum meetings are an agile practice that we have used and it has helped us with getting good communication in the team 
so everyone is aware what is supposed to be done that day or week.
### The sprint review and how it relates to your scope and customer value (Did you have a PO, if yes, who?, if no, how did you carry out the review? Did the review result in a re-prioritisation of user stories? How did the reviews relate to your DoD? Did the feedback change your way of working?)
The sprint reviews have helped us push us into the right direction more than once. 
We have redone our user stories multiple times, since it’s the first time we work with user stories, and we hadn’t really understood acceptance criterias and tasks. 
It has also helped us prioritize which user stories should be done firstly, to make sure we approach our goal the best way. 
Our DoD has also been worked on, as it’s the same story as with the user stories.
### Best practices for learning and using new tools and technologies (IDEs, version control, scrum boards etc.; 
do not only describe which tools you used but focus on how you developed the expertise to use them)
IntelliJ is our choice of IDE for developing the application. 
Most of us have previous experience with it but for learning the tool there are several guides available online on JetBrains (IntelliJ developer)  website. 
We are also using Scenebuilder and JavaFX as part of our application. There are lots of guides online and video games on websites like youtube on how to use them. 
For version control we are using Git and Github, since IntelliJ has seamless integration with both. 
### Relation to literature and guest lectures (how do your reflections relate to what others have to say?)
As far as we are aware there have been no guest lectures given. No literature has been read as part of this course as well. 
As such we don’t really have anything to write on this topic.
