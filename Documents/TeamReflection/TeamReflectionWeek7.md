# Customer Value and Scope
### The chosen scope of the application under development including the priority of features and for whom you are creating value
Over the course of the project we have had some issues regarding what we should focus on, and which features are the most important to get done. 
But this week we stated and agreed on the most important features we wanted and discussed what to finish this week. Since the project was nearing the end prioritizing specific parts of the program and what our goals were with the program was very important. We as a team did reach an agreement on what should be left to the backlog and what needed to be completed for the final delivery. 
### The success criteria for the team in terms of what you want to achieve within the project (this can include the application, 
but also your learning outcomes, your teamwork, or your effort)
### The main goal this week was to firstly decide and go through what we should complete, since this was the last week of the project. 
We did a checklist of the things we felt was the most crucial for us to finish before the week was over, and decided to scrap the remaining things, since the lack of time.
### Your user stories in terms of using a standard pattern, acceptance criteria, task breakdown and effort estimation and how this influenced the way you worked and created value
As stated above, we had to scrap some of our user stories, because of the limit of time we had. 
But the user stories we have worked on have helped us with dividing the work amongst the team and the criterias and tasks has helped us deciding how to take on the story, 
so that we are all on the same page regarding how to proceed.
### Your acceptance tests, such as how they were performed, with whom, and which value they provided for you and the other stakeholders
When someone has done and is finished with a user story, we discuss it in our daily scrum meeting and make sure we go through our DoD-checklist to ensure that everything 
works as intended. If it doesn’t we come up with solutions on how to fix the issue/s. 

# Social Contract and Effort
### Your social contract, i.e., the rules that define how you work together as a team, how it influenced your work, and how it evolved during the project
Our written social contract didn’t change at all during the course. We tried to make it realistic from the start and it works for us, 
so we didn’t feel the need to change anything since everyone is agreeing on each point in the contract.
### The time you have spent on the course and how it relates to what you delivered (so keep track of your hours so you can describe the current situation)
Different individuals have spent different amounts of time on the project. Our current situation is that we are pretty much finishing up the last few things that are in scope. 
While we could have achieved more if more time was spent on the project some of our members have already put in more hours than what the course needs. 
Other members have labs in other courses that take up a lot of time. Our scope has of course been adjusted as we went on and with more time we wouldn’t have had to reduce 
the scope as much as we have done.

# Design decisions and product structure
### How your design decisions (e.g., choice of APIs, architecture patterns, behaviour) support customer value
Nothing has changed since last week, maybe only there has been some more work with SQL this week, to finish our user stories about personal data on emissions 
being saved to the specific user.
### How you use and update your documentation throughout the sprints
Also the same as last week, everyone makes sure to keep to the agreed “code standard” that makes it easy and clear for other team members to read and edit the code if needed. 
Since this is the last sprint we will go through the code more thoroughly and remove any unnecessary comments and lines of code, 
as well as adding the final comments on each method and class.
### How you ensure code quality and enforce coding standards
We have yet to see if our approach leaves us in a lot of technical debt but have all been writing code and not really had any standardised syntax. 
One requirement we have for definition of done is that several team members look through the code and give it a uniform look. 
That way we can ensure that the code is of quality.

# Application of Scrum
### The roles you have used within the team and their impact on your work
Like last week we haven’t felt that it has been necessary for us to have different roles. 
Every individual has the responsibility to show up to meetings and contribute to our weekly deliverables. 
We still haven’t had any problems with this and if any problems were to arise we discuss this during our daily scrum meetings. 
We discussed how to approach roles at the start of the project but decided not to use any and it has worked well with everyone taking responsibility.
### The agile practices you have used and their impact on your work
We’ve been doing daily scrum meetings which help us by sharing what we have worked on, what we’re going to work on and if we need any help. 
This makes it easier to coordinate work on the project and make sure that no one struggles on a problem for too long. 
Our Trello board contains much of the information regarding the project and is also where we’re keeping our sprints. 
Sprints help us keep focused on adding value for the customer to the project. 
While maybe not directly agile Git has allowed us all to work on the same codebase but on different classes at the same time. 
### The sprint review and how it relates to your scope and customer value (Did you have a PO, if yes, who?, if no, how did you carry out the review? Did the review result in a re-prioritisation of user stories? How did the reviews relate to your DoD? Did the feedback change your way of working?)
As we have stated before, we do not have a PO. Ever since we redone our user stories our work has changed for the better. In the beginning, 
where we didn’t really know how to work with Scrum or user stories, we had issues regarding who is doing what and what to do to proceed with the project. 
And with our DoD complete, it’s easier for us to “officially” complete user stories since we now have a checklist to go through.
### Best practices for learning and using new tools and technologies (IDEs, version control, scrum boards etc.; do not only describe which tools you used but focus on how you developed the expertise to use them)
During the project we have learned how to improve our knowledge and use of Github and branches in the development of our product. 
We read about how to use branches through documentation on Github and have since improved by testing and working with branches in the projekt. 
If we have had any problems or lack of knowledge of our IDE intellij at any point we have together discussed and looked for solutions or ways to improve our use of intellij.
