1. what do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to learn how to use git and Github better in my programming projects, as I've tried use it before without much luck. 
I got pushing and pulling from master to work, I think, still gonna need to figure out branches and such.

2. how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Be there if anybody needs a second opinion or for me to check something they have written, help by giving them my take on it. 

3. what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
Not much to add from last week.

4. what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
Again, not much to add from last week.
