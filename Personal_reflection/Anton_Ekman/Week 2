Week 2 (assuming same questions this week as week 1):

1. what do I want to learn or understand better? 
Really same as week 1 not much has changed.

2. how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Same as week 1.

3. what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
This week we havent done that much so not much has been changed or attributed. 

4. what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
See question 3.


Extra: I think we are in a good place with the project. While we havent actually started with programming or even deciding on what we gonna do, 
I think everyone in the group seems to be on the same page and next week after having had a discussion with the TA I think we gonna do a good job and get this project moving.
