Week 1:

1. what do I want to learn or understand better? 

I wanna learn how to work in a team and create a effective work flow and postive work enviroment between group members. 
The reason for this is because:
1. I wanna of course pass the course
2.I think this is a very useful to learn and have in your toolbox of skills when I later enter work life and become a software developer or whatever I end up working as. 

2. how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

I can share my experience and skills with the rest of the team to help them undestand, be that pure programming or just diffrent communinication and teamwork skills that can applied during this project.
I can also just offer my subjectiv opinion and unique perspective on diffrent things. 

3. what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
  
Right now we are all new to scrum so I think we are all trying to figure it out together. I have come up with some idea as to what the theme/epics can be aswell as the 2nd KPI. 

4. what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
