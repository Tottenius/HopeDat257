This week has been a bit slower. A lot of our preparations for the project were done last week. 
This week we have mostly been discussing project ideas. When we get started with the project next week there will be more to reflect on.

1.	
I want to continue learning about GitHub and the agile process

2.	
I can help with my knowledge of GitHub and the IDE we are using if anyone needs it. I will also try to learn from the other team members on these two subjects 
which will benefit the whole team in the long run.

3.	
Help with organising meetings and be active during the meetings and the discussions. Also still be active on trello, 
staying up to date on the project and updating where I need to.

4.	
I’ve been helping to work towards finalising the idea for our project. 
I’ve been active while discussing and participating in the writing of the team reflection.
