What do I want to learn or understand better?
I would like to learn how to properly use git. This because I think it is a useful tool for a software developer. I would also like to better understand the scum process.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I think I can help the team by trying to discuss the tools we are not used to handle (git and scrum) and therefor making sure everyone gets a good understanding for them.

What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
Being an active group member and following the social contract.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
Coming with ideas and discussing the project.
